# CI/CD Branch 

This main branch hosts the pipeline for **automated forecasting of anti-malarial demand** and **district-level malaria cases**. The system is fully automated through **GitHub Actions**, which:  
- Run monthly prediction jobs  
- Update the trained models‚Äô outputs  
- Merge results into the respective **dashboard branches** for deployment  

For deployment of the full app stacks, we need to switch to main-production branch.

## üîÑ Automation Workflow  

The **main branch** orchestrates the automation.  
GitHub Actions workflows are triggered on schedule to:  
1. Generate updated predictions  
2. Integrate results into dashboards  
3. Deploy automatically without manual intervention  

---

## üìÇ Branch Structure  

The workflows rely on two key model directories:  

- **`models/`**  
  Contains trained `.keras` models for **Defined Daily Doses (DDD) demand prediction**  

- **`malaria_models/`**  
  Contains trained `.keras` models for **district-level malaria case predictions**
  - **`scripts/`**  
  Contains **python prediction generating scripts**  
 - **`results/`**  
  Contains **monthly prediction results**
 - **`data/`**  
  Contains **raw data backups used elsewhere for model development**  
---

## üöÄ Deployment  

- Predictions are pushed and merged directly into dashboard branches  
- Dashboards update seamlessly with new results after each workflow run  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Highlights  

- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation  
- **Keras** used for saving deep learning models for forecasting  
- Automated monthly prediction and dashboard refresh

 ## Branching Strategy for Prediction Solution Development

To ensure **modularity, reproducibility, and production stability**, the development workflow for the prediction solution is structured around **independent feature branches**.  
Each branch targets a specific functional component and is **integrated into the `main-production` branch** following validation.

### GitHub Feature Branches

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `1-develop-and-validate-ddd-prediction-model` | Design, training, and refinement of DDD predictive models. |
| `2-develop-malaria-cases-prediction-model` | Design, training, and refinement of malaria cases predictive models. |
| `etl` | Automated data ingestion, transformation routines, and schema updates. |
| `3-anti-malarial-ddd-prediction-dashboard` | Development of the DDD interactive decision dashboard. |
| `4-malaria-cases-dashboard` | Development of the malaria cases interactive dashboard. |

### Integration Workflow

- Feature branches are **developed and tested in isolation** to ensure functional independence.  
- Upon completion and validation, changes are merged into **`main-production`** via controlled pull requests.  
- **CI/CD pipelines** may be configured to enforce automated workflows, testing, and data synchronization across branches.  

This strategy allows parallel development of models, ETL pipelines, and dashboards while maintaining a stable production-ready branch.
