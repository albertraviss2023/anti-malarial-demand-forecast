# District-Level Malaria Cases Forecast ‚Äì Model Development Branch  

This branch contains the **development notebook** for the malaria **cases prediction model**:  

- **`develop_district_case_models.ipynb`** ‚Üí Jupyter notebook for model development, validation, and evaluation.  

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure  

- **`malaria_models/`**  
  Contains the trained `.keras` models for district-level malaria case prediction, which were **directly moved to the main branch** once finalized.  

- **`data/`**  
  The data files used are located at the root of this branch directory.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage  

1. Open the notebook `develop_district_case_models.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
2. Run the cells to train and evaluate the district-level malaria case prediction models.  
3. Trained models are saved automatically in the `malaria_models/` directory and then moved to the main branch.
